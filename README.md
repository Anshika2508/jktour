## **Installation**

### **Backend Setup (Locally)**

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jktour.git
   cd jktour
   ```

2. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment variables, like MongoDB URI (for production deployment, you can configure MongoDB Atlas):
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/userData
   ```

4. Start the server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

### **Frontend Setup**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jktour-frontend.git
   cd jktour-frontend
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the application. You can edit it with any text editor, and it will automatically reflect the changes in the browser.

3. Alternatively, you can run the static files via a simple web server for development:
   - If you have **Python** installed, you can serve the files:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```
   - The site will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

4. The frontend files are static and do not require a build process since they are made using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## **Deployment**

### **Backend Deployment**

To deploy the backend of this project, follow the steps below:

#### **Step 1: Prepare your environment**
- Ensure you have **Node.js** and **MongoDB** installed on your server or choose a cloud platform like **MongoDB Atlas** to host your database.
- Set up environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI) and add them in a `.env` file.

#### **Step 2: Clone the repository**
Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jktour-backend.git
cd jktour-backend
```

#### **Step 3: Install dependencies**
Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### **Step 4: Set up MongoDB**
- **Local MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: If using Atlas, create a cluster and replace the `MONGODB_URI` in the `.env` file with your Atlas URI.

#### **Step 5: Start the backend**
To start the backend server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on port `4000`. You can access the backend API at `http://localhost:4000`.

#### **Step 6: Deploy to a Cloud Platform (Optional)**
To deploy the backend on platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS EC2**, or **Google Cloud**, follow the respective platform's deployment guide and configure your environment variables accordingly.
